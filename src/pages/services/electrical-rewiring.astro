      <h2 class="text-3xl font-medium mb-6">Electrical Installation Condition Report (EICR)</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        An Electrical Installation Condition Report (EICR) is an essential part of maintaining a safe and compliant property. This detailed inspection, carried out by a qualified electrician, assesses the condition of your electrical wiring, consumer unit, and all electrical components throughout the property. During the inspection, the electrician checks for signs of damage, wear, or deterioration in the electrical installation, as well as any potential hazards that could compromise safety.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        The EICR provides a clear understanding of the overall state of your wiring and highlights any areas that require urgent attention or future upgrades. For homeowners, it is recommended to have an EICR completed every 10 years, while landlords are required to obtain one every 5 years to meet legal obligations. This report not only ensures your installation is up to current standards but also helps prevent electrical faults and supports insurance and compliance needs.

    <div class="max-w-screen-xl mx-auto">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-medium mb-6">Preparation for Rewiring</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Proper preparation is the foundation of a successful rewiring project. Before the rewiring process begins, it's important to carefully plan the location of every light, switch, and socket in each room. Take the time to map out where you want sockets, switches, and lighting points, as well as additional features like smoke detectors, extractor fans, security lights, and smart home devices. This level of planning helps avoid costly changes or additions later in the rewiring job.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider how your needs may change in the future—think about the number of sockets required for modern appliances and technology, and allow for extra capacity to accommodate new devices over the next decade. By planning ahead, you ensure your rewiring job delivers a flexible, future-proof solution tailored to your lifestyle.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-medium mb-6">Consumer Unit Upgrade</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Upgrading the consumer unit is a key part of many rewiring projects, especially if your current fuse box is outdated or lacks modern safety features. The consumer unit is the central hub for your property's electrical installation, distributing power safely to all circuits. A new consumer unit will include advanced circuit breakers and residual current devices (RCDs), which provide enhanced protection against electrical shocks and help prevent electrical fires.
      </p>
      <p>
        All consumer unit upgrades must be completed by a qualified electrician to ensure compliance with building regulations and the latest safety standards. Investing in a modern consumer unit not only improves the safety and efficiency of your electrical system but also ensures your property meets current legal requirements.

  <!-- REWIRING SAFETY PRECAUTIONS -->
  <section class="py-20 px-4">
    <div class="max-w-screen-xl mx-auto">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-medium mb-6">Rewiring Safety Precautions</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Safety is paramount when rewiring a house. The rewiring process involves working with wires and electrical components that can pose serious risks if not handled correctly. Before any rewiring work begins, it is crucial to switch off the power supply to the property to eliminate the risk of electric shock.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Hidden cabling and wires within walls and floors can be easily damaged during the rewiring process, so a qualified electrician should always be responsible for the work. Professional electricians have the expertise to identify potential hazards, manage the safe removal of old wiring, and install new systems in line with safety regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
        By prioritizing safety and using a qualified electrician, you protect your property and everyone in it throughout the rewiring job.

      <p class="mb-6">
        After the rewiring project is complete, thorough testing is essential to confirm that the new electrical installation is safe and fully operational. A qualified electrician will inspect all wiring, the consumer unit, and electrical components, ensuring that everything meets current regulations and functions as intended.

        The electrician will provide an Electrical Installation Certificate, along with a detailed schedule of test readings and inspections, to document the quality and safety of the installation. This official certification gives homeowners peace of mind, knowing that their property's electrics are compliant, efficient, and ready for everyday use.

            index: 1,
            title: "How do I know if my property needs a full rewire?",
            description: "Common signs include old rubber, fabric, or aluminium wiring, frequent tripping, flickering lights, warm sockets, burning smells, outdated fuse boxes without RCDs, and failed EICRs. Properties more than 25–30 years old may also require rewiring to meet modern electrical demand."
          },
          {
            index: 2,
            title: "What is the difference between a full rewire and a partial rewire?",
            description: "A full rewire replaces all electrical wiring, accessories, and the consumer unit. A partial rewire targets specific circuits or areas—such as a kitchen, extension, or damaged wiring. Partial rewires are suitable when the rest of the installation is safe and compliant."

            index: 3,
            title: "How long does a house rewire take?",
            description: "Typical timeframes are 2–4 days for a 1-bed flat, 4–7 days for a 2–3 bed house, and 1–2 weeks for larger homes or commercial spaces. Project length depends on access, property layout, and whether the building is occupied."
          },
          {
            index: 4,
            title: "Can you live in a property during a rewire?",
            description: "Yes, but it can be disruptive. We phase work so essential power remains available where possible, use floor protection, maintain clear walkways, and restore circuits temporarily if needed. Some customers choose temporary accommodation for comfort."
          },
          {
            index: 5,
            title: "Will you need to remove plaster or lift flooring?",
            description: "In most rewires, floorboards are lifted and channels are cut into walls to route new wiring. We minimise damage where possible and ensure the property is left clean and ready for redecoration. Surface-mounted options are available in certain cases."
          },
          {
            index: 6,
            title: "Does a rewire include a new consumer unit?",
            description: "Yes. Most rewires include installing a modern consumer unit with RCDs, surge protection, and MCB/RCBO protection. This ensures full compliance with current BS 7671 regulations."

            index: 7,
            title: "What certificates do I receive after a rewire?",

            index: 8,
            title: "Is rewiring a legal requirement?",
            description: "While not strictly legal unless part of rental compliance, any unsafe, outdated, or non-compliant wiring must be corrected. Landlords must provide a safe electrical installation and pass EICR inspections every 5 years. Failed EICR items often require partial or full rewiring."

            index: 9,
            title: "How much does a full rewire cost?",
            description: "Costs depend on property size, number of circuits, access, and the level of specification. Typical guide prices range from £2,500 for small flats to £4,500+ for larger homes. Custom quotes are provided following a survey."
          },
          {
            index: 10,
            title: "Can you add extra sockets, lights, and smart tech during the rewire?",
            description: "Yes. A rewire is the ideal time to plan additional sockets, lighting upgrades, smoke alarms, extractor fans, Ethernet/data cabling, smart heating, and EV charger readiness. Future-proof designs reduce long-term costs."
          },
          {
            index: 11,
            title: "Do commercial properties require different rewiring standards?",

            index: 12,
            title: "What causes wiring to deteriorate over time?",
            description: "Heat, age, overloading, incorrect installation, rodent damage, environmental moisture, and outdated materials all contribute to wiring deterioration. Older systems lack modern safety features, making rewiring essential for long-term protection."
          },
          {
            index: 13,
            title: "Will a rewire increase my property value?",
            description: "Yes. A fully rewired property is more appealing to buyers, reduces future electrical issues, passes EICRs easily, and supports modern appliances and smart technology. It can also help with mortgage approval during property sales."
