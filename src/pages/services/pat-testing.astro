      <h2 class="text-3xl font-medium mb-6">What is PAT Testing?</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        PAT (Portable Appliance Testing) involves the visual inspection and electrical testing of any appliance that is powered by a plug. PAT testing includes a series of electrical tests using specialized test equipment, such as a portable appliance tester, to verify the safety of appliances and ensure they meet regulatory standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal is to ensure it is safe for continued use and to prevent electric shock or fire hazards from faulty equipment.

          In environments such as own offices, the risk level for portable electrical equipment is typically lower, so routine visual inspections may be sufficient. In contrast, high risk settings like construction sites require more frequent checks and testing of portable electrical items to ensure safety and compliance.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          If your premises have staff, tenants, or members of the public using plug-in electrical appliances, PAT testing is either a legal duty or a key requirement for insurance and risk management. Faults reported during routine checks or inspections of portable electrical appliances may trigger further action or additional testing to maintain ongoing safety.

    <div class="max-w-screen-xl mx-auto">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-medium mb-6">Health and Safety Benefits</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Portable appliance testing (PAT) is a vital component of any workplace health and safety strategy, offering significant protection against electrical accidents and fire risks associated with faulty electrical equipment. By carrying out regular PAT tests and visual inspections, businesses can identify and address potential hazards before they lead to serious incidents, ensuring that all electrical appliances are operating correctly and safely.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Implementing a robust portable appliance testing regime demonstrates a clear commitment to electrical safety and compliance with the Electricity at Work Regulations. This proactive approach not only helps prevent electrical shocks, fires, and other accidents but also reduces the likelihood of legal action and reputational harm. Regular PAT testing, combined with user checks and formal visual inspections, allows businesses to detect faults early, maintain portable electric equipment to a high standard, and minimize costly downtime.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) strongly recommends that employers and duty holders conduct regular PAT tests as part of their responsibility to provide a safe working environment. This involves a combination of user checks, visual inspections, and formal testing using appropriate PAT testing equipment. Adhering to these best practice guidelines ensures compliance with safety regulations and helps businesses stay compliant with their legal obligations.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        The frequency of portable appliance testing should be tailored to the specific risks of each environment. In low risk environments, such as offices, annual portable appliance testing may be sufficient. However, in higher risk settings—like construction sites or workshops—more frequent PAT tests may be required to ensure ongoing safety. It is essential that a competent person, such as a qualified electrician or trained PAT tester, carries out these inspections and tests to guarantee accurate results and effective risk management.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, portable appliance testing is an essential part of maintaining a safe and healthy workplace. By prioritizing regular PAT testing and thorough inspections, businesses can prevent danger, ensure compliance with work regulations, and protect both staff and visitors from electrical hazards. This not only fulfills legal requirements but also supports greater control over equipment safety, reduces the risk of electrical accidents, and contributes to a productive, reliable working environment.

        {[
          {
            index: 1,
            title: "Is PAT testing a legal requirement?",
            description: "PAT testing itself is not directly required by law. However, duty holders must ensure electrical equipment is safe for use under the Electricity at Work Regulations 1989. PAT testing is the most recognised and accepted method to demonstrate compliance, especially for insurance, landlords, and commercial environments."
          },
          {
            index: 2,
            title: "How often should PAT testing be done?",
            description: "Frequency depends on appliance type, risk level, and environment. Offices often require testing every 12–24 months, kitchens every 6–12 months, and construction sites every 3–6 months. Rental properties typically require annual testing or at each new tenancy. We create a tailored schedule based on risk assessment."
          },
          {
            index: 3,
            title: "What appliances need PAT testing?",
            description: "Any item that plugs into a socket should be tested. This includes kettles, computers, extension leads, heaters, hairdryers, microwaves, power tools, and white goods. Both Class I (earthed) and Class II (double insulated) appliances are included in testing."
          },
          {
            index: 4,
            title: "Does PAT testing include visual inspection?",
            description: "Yes. Visual inspections are the first and most important step. We check plugs, cables, casings, fuses, strain relief, and safety markings. Many faults are identified before electrical testing begins, reducing risk and preventing failures."
          },
          {
            index: 5,
            title: "How long does PAT testing take?",
            description: "Small sites may take under an hour. Larger sites with 50–200+ items may take several hours or a full day, depending on access and working hours. We offer out-of-hours testing to minimise disruption to businesses and public premises."
          },
          {
            index: 6,
            title: "Can PAT testing be done during office hours?",
            description: "Yes. We work efficiently around staff and equipment. Where equipment cannot be switched off during working time, we can test during early mornings, evenings, or weekends."
          },
          {
            index: 7,
            title: "Do you provide certificates after testing?",
            description: "Yes. You receive a full digital PAT Testing Certificate, an itemised asset report, pass/fail labels, retest dates, and any recommendations. These documents satisfy insurers, local authorities, and health & safety auditors."
          },
          {
            index: 8,
            title: "What happens if an appliance fails PAT testing?",
            description: "We label the item as failed, remove it from use, and detail the fault in the report. Simple repairs—such as replacing plugs or fuses—are often fixed immediately. If the item is unsafe or unrepairable, we explain replacement options."
          },
          {
            index: 9,
            title: "Can landlords use PAT testing to meet HMO compliance?",
            description: "Yes. HMOs and rental properties must ensure all electrical appliances provided to tenants are safe. Annual PAT testing is widely accepted by local councils as evidence of compliance during inspections and licensing renewals."
          },
          {
            index: 10,
            title: "Are battery-powered appliances included?",
            description: "Battery-only devices typically fall outside PAT testing, but any appliance that can be charged via mains (Class III chargers) may require inspection of the charger or transformer unit. We assess relevance during the site visit."
          },
          {
            index: 11,
            title: "What is a 'competent person' for PAT testing?",
            description: "A competent person is someone trained to recognise faults, carry out formal visual inspections, and perform electrical tests safely. Our testing is completed by qualified electricians or trained PAT technicians using calibrated instruments."
          },
          {
            index: 12,
            title: "Does PAT testing prevent fires?",
            description: "PAT testing identifies damaged cables, loose connections, internal faults, overheating risks, and insulation breakdown—key causes of electrical fires. Regular testing significantly reduces the risk of electrical accidents in homes and workplaces."
          },
          {
            index: 13,
            title: "How much does PAT testing cost?",
            description: "Costs start from £75 for up to 20 items, with discounts for higher volumes. The more appliances tested, the lower the cost per item. Pricing includes all labels, reports, and minor repairs such as replacing fuses or rewiring plugs."
          },
          {
            index: 14,
            title: "Can PAT testing be combined with other services?",

          },
          {
            index: 15,
            title: "Do I need PAT testing for my business insurance?",
            description: "Most insurers require regular PAT testing as part of their risk mitigation policy. Failure to maintain safe portable appliances can invalidate insurance or delay claims related to electrical faults."
          },
          {
            index: 16,
            title: "What is included in the final PAT testing report?",
