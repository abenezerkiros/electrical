      <h2 class="text-3xl font-medium mb-6">What Is an Electric Shower?</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        An electric shower heats cold mains water on demand using an integrated heating element powered by electricity. This is how an electric shower works: it heats water instantly as it passes through the unit using an internal element, and it does not rely on a boiler, making it a reliable option even during boiler breakdowns.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Unlike mixer or gravity-fed systems, it only takes water directly from the mains cold water supply and doesn't rely on stored hot water—making it ideal for:

  <!-- ELECTRIC SHOWER BENEFITS -->
  <section class="py-20 bg-gray px-4">
    <div class="max-w-screen-xl mx-auto">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-medium mb-6">Electric Shower Benefits</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Electric showers provide a range of benefits that make them a smart choice for many households. One of the main advantages is their energy efficiency—since an electric shower only heats the water you use, it can help reduce energy costs compared to traditional systems that keep a tank of hot water ready.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        This makes electric showers especially appealing for homes with limited hot water supply or where the cost of running a full system is a concern. Whether you're looking to install a new shower or replace an old unit, electric showers offer flexibility with a variety of power ratings to suit your needs and budget.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their straightforward installation process means less disruption and quicker access to a reliable hot shower. With a modern electric shower unit, you can enjoy consistent hot water, lower running costs, and a solution that fits seamlessly into your bathroom.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-medium mb-6">Combi Boiler Compatibility</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        If your home uses a combi boiler, electric showers are an excellent option to consider. Unlike mixer showers, which rely on the combi boiler to provide hot water, electric showers take water directly from the cold water supply and heat it instantly within the unit. This means you can enjoy a hot shower even if your combi boiler is under heavy demand or temporarily out of action.
      </p>
      <p>
        For safe and effective operation, electric showers require a dedicated circuit, which must be installed by a qualified electrician. Before installing, it's important to assess your water system and ensure the electric shower is compatible with your existing setup. By choosing an electric shower, you can avoid overloading your combi boiler and guarantee a steady supply of hot water whenever you need it.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-medium mb-6">Water System Considerations</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">
          Before you install an electric shower, it's crucial to evaluate your home's water system to ensure optimal performance. Electric showers need a direct cold water supply pipe connected to the shower unit, so you'll want to confirm that your plumbing can handle the extra demand.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're planning a new shower installation, you may need to upgrade your water system or add a new pipe to support the electric shower. Water pressure is another key factor—electric showers require a minimum pressure to operate efficiently, so it's wise to have a plumber or electrician check your system before proceeding. Proper planning and assessment will help you avoid issues and ensure your new electric shower delivers a powerful, consistent flow every time.

      <p class="mb-6">
        In some situations, installing an electric shower may mean you need a new consumer unit. This is typically necessary if your current consumer unit is outdated or doesn't have the capacity to support the extra electrical load from the shower. A new consumer unit allows for a dedicated circuit, which is essential for the safe and reliable operation of your electric shower.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's important to have a qualified electrician assess your existing electrical system and carry out the installation to meet all safety standards. By upgrading to a new consumer unit, you ensure your electric shower is properly protected and your home's electrics remain safe and compliant for years to come.
