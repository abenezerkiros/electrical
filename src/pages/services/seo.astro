    question: "Why is professional ceiling fan installation important?",

  },
  {
    question: "How long does a typical ceiling fan installation take?",
    answer: "Most standard ceiling fan installations are completed within 2-3 hours. However, this timeframe may vary depending on your ceiling type, existing wiring, and whether additional supports are needed for secure mounting."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide the ceiling fan or should I purchase one?",
    answer: "We offer both options! You can choose from our selection of high-quality, energy-efficient ceiling fans, or we can install a fan you've already purchased. Our team will ensure it's compatible with your space and electrical system."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you install ceiling fans in rooms without existing fixtures?",
    answer: "Yes, we can install ceiling fans in rooms without existing fixtures. This process requires running new wiring and potentially cutting a new opening in the ceiling, which our experienced electricians handle with minimal disruption to your home."
