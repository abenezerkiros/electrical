      <h2 class="text-3xl font-medium mb-6">Introduction to Cooker Installation</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Installing a new electric cooker is a vital step in upgrading your kitchen, ensuring both safety and optimal performance from your new appliance. Whether you've chosen an electric cooker, a gas cooker, or a dual fuel cooker, proper cooker installation is essential to protect your investment and maintain the manufacturer's guarantee.
      </p>
      <p>
        The installation process involves more than simply connecting wires—it requires careful attention to power supply, wiring, and proper ventilation to prevent hazards and ensure efficient operation. By hiring a professional electrician, you can be confident that your new electric cooker will be installed safely, in compliance with all regulations, and ready to deliver reliable cooking results for years to come.

  <!-- CHOOSING THE RIGHT COOKER -->
  <section class="py-20 px-4">
    <div class="max-w-screen-xl mx-auto">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-medium mb-6">Choosing the Right Cooker</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Selecting the right cooker is the foundation of a successful cooker installation. With a wide range of options available—including electric cookers, gas cookers, dual fuel cookers, built-in ovens, and range cookers—it's important to consider your kitchen layout, cooking habits, and budget.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Electric cookers are popular for their straightforward installation and compatibility with modern kitchens, but may require a dedicated circuit. Gas cookers offer precise heat control but must be installed by a Gas Safe registered engineer. Dual fuel cookers combine the best of both worlds, offering electric ovens with gas hobs for versatile cooking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding the installation process and circuit requirements for each type of cooker will help you make an informed choice and ensure your new appliance fits seamlessly into your kitchen.

  <!-- PREPARATION FOR INSTALLATION -->
  <section class="py-20 bg-gray px-4">
    <div class="max-w-screen-xl mx-auto">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-medium mb-6">Preparation for Installation</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Proper preparation is key to a smooth and efficient cooker installation. Before your new electric cooker arrives, make sure the installation area is clear of any obstructions and that there is adequate space for the appliance.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Check that the power supply is accessible and that the location allows for proper ventilation, which is essential for safe operation. If you're replacing an existing appliance, ensure it is fully disconnected and removed, and have your new appliance unpacked and ready for installation.
      </p>
      <p>
        A professional installation service can provide expert advice on preparing your kitchen, helping you choose the best location for your cooker and ensuring all safety requirements are met before the installation process begins.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-medium mb-6">Tools and Materials Needed</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Having the right tools and materials on hand is essential for a safe and efficient electric cooker installation. Key items include a cooker control unit, an isolating switch, and the appropriate wiring materials to match your appliance's requirements.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        It's also important to have the manufacturer's instructions and any relevant safety guidelines available during the installation process. While some homeowners may be tempted to tackle installation themselves, working with a professional electrician ensures that all connections are made safely and in compliance with regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
        A qualified professional will bring the necessary expertise, tools, and materials to complete the installation to the highest standard, giving you peace of mind and a fully functional cooker.

            description: "Yes. Hobs often require separate cabling and control depending on power draw. Induction hobs especially demand high-load circuits and RCD protection. Dual-fuel or induction hobs are also versatile, allowing you to prepare a wide variety of dishes to suit different cooking styles."
