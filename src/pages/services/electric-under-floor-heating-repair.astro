    <div class="max-w-screen-xl mx-auto">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-medium mb-6">Electric Systems and Compatibility</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Choosing the right electric underfloor heating system for your home involves considering the type of cable, installation method, and compatibility with your chosen floor covering. Electric underfloor heating systems typically use cables or mats installed beneath the floor surface, and the best system for your property will depend on factors such as room size, floor type, and insulation. For example, some electric underfloor heating systems are specifically designed for use under tile or stone, while others are suitable for installation beneath laminate, wood, or even carpet. It's important to select a system that matches your flooring and heating requirements to ensure optimal performance and energy efficiency. Homeowners should also factor in the cost of installation, the type of thermostat for precise temperature control, and the level of insulation to maximize the effectiveness of the heating system.
